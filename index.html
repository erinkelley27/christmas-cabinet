        <p class="home-text">We LOVE the Christmas story! Which is why we created The Christmas Cabinet! The Christmas
            Cabinet is an Advent Calendar that creates a nativity scene. It is an heirloom that can be passed from
            generation to generation, creating Christmas memories that will last a lifetime and beyond. Starting
            December 1, open each day’s numbered drawer, one per day until December 24th, Christmas Eve. Each drawer
            holds a figure that represents the Christmas story, everything from genuine frankincense to the reproduction
            of a Roman statue of Caesar Augustus, as well as angels, little lambs and even John the Baptist and his
            parents. Read the story on the bottom of the drawer or from the included book. Arrange the 25 figures from
            the drawers to complete your own nativity scene and watch the greatest story ever told unfold!
        </p>

        <p class="home-text">Don’t worry of you lose one of the figures, you can order a replacement part here. Believe
            me, we understand! It happens. When my youngest was two, he flushed baby Jesus down the toilet.
            Unfortunately he was never the same again...my son that is, not Jesus!</p>
